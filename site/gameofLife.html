      <p>
        The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970.<br>
        It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input.<br>
        The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evolution of the game is governed by simple rules:
        <ul>
          <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).</li>
          <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        To interact with the game, click on cells to toggle their state.<br>
        Experiment with different initial configurations and observe how the patterns evolve over time.
